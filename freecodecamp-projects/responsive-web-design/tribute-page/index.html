<!--UNORDERED LIST OF FACTS-->
      
        <ul>
          <li> <strong> Born as: </strong>George Ivanovich Gurdjieff around 1866–1877 in Alexandropol (actual Armenia).</li>
          
          <li> <strong> Taught: </strong>that most humans do not possess a unified consciousness and thus live their lives in a state of hypnotic "waking sleep", but that it is possible to awaken to a higher state of consciousness and achieve full human potential through The Work on Oneself or "The System".</li>
          
          <li> <strong> Teaching Fundamentals </strong>Gurdjieff's method for awakening one's consciousness unites the methods of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakir" target="_blank">fakir</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk" target="_blank">monk</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi" target="_blank">yogi</a> , and thus he referred to it as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Way" target="_blank">"Fourth Way"</a>.</li>
       
          <li> <strong> Grew up on a</strong> grassy plateau-steppe and high mountains, which was inhabited by a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional population.</li>
          
          <li> <strong> Travelled </strong> in search of "the truth" to many destinations from the birthland as for example to:  Central Asia, Egypt, Iran, India, Tibet, Rome, Russia, United States of America and France.</li>
         
          <li> <strong> Self-development teachings. </strong> Gurdjieff taught people how to increase and focus their attention and energy in various ways and to minimize daydreaming and absentmindedness.</li>
          
          <li> <strong> Methods. </strong> Gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials, including meetings, music, movements (sacred dance), writings, lectures, and innovative forms of group and individual work.</li>
          
           <li> <strong> Music. </strong> Apart of Caucasian and Central Asian folk and religious music, Russian Orthodox liturgical music, and other sources, Gurdjieff wrote many pieces with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_de_Hartmann">Thomas de Hartmann</a>.</li>
          
          
          <li> <strong> Movements </strong> or sacred dances, constitute an integral part of the Gurdjieff Work. Gurdjieff sometimes referred to himself as a "teacher of dancing" and gained initial public notice for his attempts to put on a ballet in Moscow called Struggle of the Magicians.</li>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Way">
      <p>
        Gurdjieff said that "two or three thousand years ago there were yet other ways which no longer exist and the ways then in existence were not so divided, they stood much closer to one another. The fourth way differs from the old and the new ways by the fact that it is never a permanent way. It has no definite forms and there are no institutions connected with it."
